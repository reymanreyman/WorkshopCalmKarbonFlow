.. note::

  Review :ref:`calm_basics` before proceeding with the lab to familiarize yourself with the UI and common terminology used in Nutanix Calm.

  Estimated time to complete: **170 MINUTES**

In this exercise you will configure a Project to contain your Blueprints and Applications created throughout the Workshop.

Creating A Project
++++++++++++++++++

Open \https://*<Prism-Central-IP>*:9440/ in a browser and log in.

From the navigation bar, click ( |menu-icon| top left corner) **Menu** > **Services** > **Calm** (if you're running PC <5.10, then select **Calm** on top navigation bar)

Projects are the logical construct that integrate Calm with Nutanix's native Self-Service Portal (SSP) capabilities, allowing an administrator to assign both infrastructure resources and the roles/permissions of Active Directory users/groups to specific Blueprints and Applications.

Select |proj-icon| **Projects** from the sidebar.

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Nutanix Calm is a fully integrated component of the Nutanix stack. Easily enabled, highly available out of the box in a Scale Out Prism Central deployment, and takes advantage of non-disruptive One Click upgrades for new features and fixes.
- By using different projects assigned to different clusters and users, administrators can ensure that workloads are deployed the right way each time.  For example, a developer can be a Project Admin for a dev/test project, so they have full control to deploy to their development clusters or to a cloud, while having Read Only access to production projects, allowing them access to logs but no ability to alter production workloads.
